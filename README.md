## Review
We used three models: 
> * decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes.
we used the following measures: accuracy, F1 Score, weighted recall and weighted precision.
> * Decision tree: support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
> * Random forest: a powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm that grows and combines multiple decision trees to create a “forest.” It can be used for both classification and regression problems.
> * Naive Bayes classifiers: a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem.
